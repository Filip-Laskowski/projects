## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to run this project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install:
- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). MacOS and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

### Installing

**Step 1**: Clone the Repo
On the command line, in any directory you'd like to have the project, type:

git clone 
```

**Step 2**: Navigate to the directory
```
cd 
```

**Step 3**: Install dependencies
